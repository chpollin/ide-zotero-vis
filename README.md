# IDE Explorer

This project is a lightweight single-page web application that visualizes bibliographic data from the Institute for Documentology and Editing (IDE) Zotero library.

1. **Timeline** – chronological view of items
2. **Map** – geographical distribution using Leaflet
3. **Network** – relations between creators and items
4. **Topics** – tag frequency overview

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser with internet access.
2. The app will load data from the Zotero group (ID `4712864`).
3. Use the navigation buttons to switch between visualizations.

No build step is required. All dependencies are loaded from CDNs at runtime.
