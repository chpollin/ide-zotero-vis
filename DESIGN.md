## IDE Explorer: Design Specification

### Visual Identity

**Color System**
- Primary: Deep teal (#1a5e63), Oxford blue (#14213d)
- Secondary: Amber (#e9c46a), Burgundy (#800e13)
- Neutrals: Light gray (#f5f5f5), Dark gray (#333333)
- Data visualization palette: 6 distinct colors for categories

**Typography**
- Headers: Merriweather (serif)
- Body: Inter (sans-serif)
- Data labels: Inter Condensed
- Font sizes: 14px base, scale ratio 1.25

**Visual Language**
- Clean, academic aesthetic with digital elements
- Generous whitespace (min 16px between components)
- Subtle shadows for layering (2px blur, 10% opacity)
- Rounded corners on interactive elements (4px radius)

### Layout Structure

**Screen Composition**
- Header (60px height)
- Main visualization area (70% of remaining height)
- Context panel (30% width, right side)
- Timeline footer (80px height, persistent)

**Navigation**
- Horizontal tabs in header
- Visual indicators for current view
- Consistent position across all screens

**Responsive Breakpoints**
- Desktop: 1200px+
- Tablet: 768px-1199px
- Mobile: optimized views not required

### Visualizations

**Timeline**
- Horizontal axis with year/month divisions
- Events as circles (8-16px diameter)
- Size encoding: importance/significance
- Color encoding: event type
- Density indicators using subtle background gradients

**Map**
- Simplified European map (no detailed borders)
- Location markers sized by activity frequency
- Connections shown with curved, semi-transparent lines
- Clustering for nearby locations
- Subtle geographic texture in background

**Network**
- Force-directed graph with physics simulation
- Nodes: circular with icon indicators for type
- Connections: thin lines with opacity for strength
- Clustering by topic with background shading
- Interactive expansion/collapse for clusters

**Topics**
- Organic "archipelago" shapes for thematic areas
- Size proportional to content volume
- Proximity indicating relationship strength
- Color intensity for temporal concentration
- Topographic-style contours for subtopics

### Interaction Design

**States**
- Default: neutral color, standard opacity
- Hover: slight enlargement, increased opacity
- Selected: highlighted color, full opacity, subtle glow
- Related: secondary highlight, mid opacity

**Controls**
- Filters: Dropdown/toggle controls in header
- Selection: Direct click/tap on elements
- Navigation: Tab system for visualization modes
- Details: Expansion controls in context panel

**Transitions**
- Duration: 300ms for state changes
- Easing: Cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)
- Movement: Meaningful animation between states
- Loading: Elegant fade-in for new content

### UI Components

**Context Panel**
- Title bar with item name
- Metadata section (date, location, type)
- Description/abstract area
- Related items section
- Action links (view source, related items)

**Filters**
- Time range selector (integrated with timeline)
- Type filters (multiselect)
- Location filters (map-based selection)
- People filters (alphabetical list)
- Topic filters (hierarchical selectors)

**Information Display**
- Tooltips: appear on hover after 200ms delay
- Information cards: consistent format across visualizations
- Progressive disclosure: from summary to detail

**Navigation**
- Mode tabs: Timeline, Map, Network, Topics
- Breadcrumb trail for exploration path
- "Back to overview" button

### Narrative Elements

**Introduction**
- Brief overlay cards with explanation on first visit
- Dismissible with "don't show again" option

**Guided Exploration**
- Subtle highlighting of interesting patterns
- "Discover more" prompts at key points
- Featured story elements for major developments

**Context Provision**
- Timeline annotations for significant periods
- Geographic context for important locations
- Biographical snippets for key contributors

### Technical Design Considerations

**Performance Optimizations**
- Virtualization for large datasets
- Progressive loading of visualization components
- Efficient re-rendering patterns

**Interaction Feedback**
- Immediate visual response to user actions (<100ms)
- Loading indicators for operations >300ms
- Success/error states for user actions

**Accessibility Considerations**
- Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1
- Alternative text for visual elements
- Keyboard navigation support

### Implementation Notes

- Implement using styled-components or Tailwind CSS
- SVG-based visualizations with D3.js
- Leaflet for mapping components
- Component-based architecture with React
